This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose isolation, as the whole fiber is used. From these fibers together with the dry moulding technology, BIO-LUTIONS will produce a variety of sustainable single-use disposable products such as service food items (cutlery and tableware) as well as protein,fruit and vegetable packaging. By introducing the new dry moulding technology provided by PulPac, production can now benefit from the unique cost and quality advantages compared to existing cellulose forming solutions.<\/p>\n<p>The cooperation with PulPac opens the door to an additional production technology for fibre moulding, allowing for technology diversification as well as optimisation of dry moulding processes. The Dry Molded Fiber technology saves significant amounts of valuable water resources and energy, resulting in up to 80% lower CO2 footprint compared to alternatives. The process is extremely fast and more efficient than conventional fiber forming methods. While the Dry Molded Fiber technology will not be used for all BIO-LUTIONS\u2019 products, it does offer significant production advantages for a large variety of single-use products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEach company brings something unique and valuable to the table. Being able to create partnerships that prioritize creating real solutions to the plastic age, rather than trying to build walls is what will make true change possible. That is why we are very excited to include dry moulding from PulPac as a second core production technique\u201d Eduardo Gordillo, CEO BIO-LUTIONS.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBIO-LUTIONS is an innovative and fast-moving partner. We share a doer attitude and a clear-cut commitment to replace single-use plastics at scale. Having products on the market already this year will take the concept of sustainable packaging a big leap forward. We look forward to a long-term partnership where we can share know-how and expertise to leverage the full potential of dry moulding within BIO-LUTIONS\u2019 operations and customer network.\u201d says Linus Larsson, CEO, PulPac AB.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bio-lutions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PulPac_Biolutions-partnership-announcement_english.pdf\"><strong>Click here for PDF Download<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The German Clean Tech Startup BIO-LUTIONS and PulPac, the Dry Molded Fiber pioneer are natural allies in their objective to replace single-use plastics globally.
