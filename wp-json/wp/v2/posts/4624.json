Known as the Deonardumping ground, it has long exceeded its capacity as a landfill. Attempts to ensure a scientific closure of the site have\u00a0yet\u00a0to materialise, and it frequently reminds residents in neighbouringareas of its presence by\u00a0catching fireand\u00a0sending pollution levels\u00a0in the city soaring. With the pollution come discussions about the large amounts of waste Indian cities are generating.<\/p>\n<p>India\u00a0produces\u00a0an estimated 62 million tonnesof municipal solid waste annually, a figure which is likely to reach 165 million tonnesby 2030. As per a 2015\u00a0study\u00a0by the Central Pollution Control Board, close to 26,000 tonnesof plastic waste is generated every day in the country. While there have been efforts to address this problem \u2013 in June, the Maharashtra government banned single-use plastic, among the 25 Indian states\u00a0and union territories to do so \u2013 the implementation continues to be lax. According to the industry body FICCI, the plastic packaging industry in India is worth\u00a0$32 billion, and India exports to 150 countries.<\/p>\n<p>[\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>Technology is now providing some alternatives. Bio-lutions, a German company that uses agricultural waste to produce packaging as well as tableware, successfully completed its pilot project in Bengaluru\u2019s Jakkurneighbourhoodand their first full-fledged plant began operations in September in Ramanagara, 40 km away from the city. The plant will use 1,500 to 2,000 tonnesof fibresannually \u2013 from plants like sugarcane, banana and tomato \u2013 along with wheat and rice straw bought locally from the farmers in Mandya, and convert it all into packaging for fruits and vegetables, electronics, trays for surgical equipment and bio-plastic foil for materials that require a waterproof surface. Eduardo Gordillo, who founded Bio-lutionsin 2012, feels there is a market for companies like his in India because of the waste management problem in the country. \u201cThe industry retailers are looking for alternatives because of the ban on plastic bags,\u201d said Gordillo. \u201cWhile plastic and paper are cheap, technologies like ours can make alternatives at competitive prices.\u201d He believes technology like the one Bio-lutionsoffers can help provide farmers a profitable outlet as well.<\/p>\n<p>[\u2026]<\/p>\n<div  class='avia-button-wrap avia-button-center  avia-builder-el-0  avia-builder-el-no-sibling ' ><a href='http:\/\/<a href=\"https:\/\/scroll.in\/magazine\/893900\/to-tackle-indias-growing-waste-problem-some-companies-are-changing-the-way-they-package-products\">https:\/\/nur-positive-nachrichten.de\/positive-nachrichten\/bio-verpackungen-aus-agrarabfaellen'  class='avia-button  avia-color-theme-color   avia-icon_select-yes-left-icon avia-size-small avia-position-center '   ><span class='avia_button_icon avia_button_icon_left ' aria-hidden='true' data-av_icon='\ue84d' data-av_iconfont='entypo-fontello'><\/span><span class='avia_iconbox_title' >Read on<\/span><\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The demand for sustainable packaging, made of paper, jute, cloth and even plants, is increasing around the country.
