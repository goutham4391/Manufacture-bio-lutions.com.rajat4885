										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>09.December 2021, Germany:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Bio-based tech companies India and Zelfo Technology GmbH </strong><strong>announce a fusion of their interests. Active in agro-fibre engineering and end product </strong><strong>manufacturing, both innovative companies have deepened their relationship together via a </strong><strong>share exchange.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This move comes after a long courtship of 8 years involving a virtual co-habitation of each other’s businesses and continued cooperation. Both companies have played the long game, starting with a vision beyond the accepted horizon of sustainable practice back in 2014. The mutual goal was clear: to replace disposable plastic products by finding a way to make natural fibres gained from agricultural residuals a usable raw material.</p>
<p class="p1">Beginning with a “no limits trial and error” approach back in 2014, the two newcomers to the moulded fibre market took on an industry with little idea of what could or wouldn’t work! Cake tins, microwaves, hot plates, hand mixers etc. were used along the way to get the basis of agricultural fibre composites to mesh together. Today, their technology includes 3 unique patents, covering fibre processing, machine components as well as wet and dry fibre molding.</p>
<p class="p1">The share exchange of these two innovative companies strengthens their natural alliance and paves the way for greater market impact. Fibre engineering experts ZELFO Technology and Clean Tech Startup BIO-LUTIONS with their focus on natural fibre product development and manufacturing, will further intensify their cooperation in a strategic move forward. The companies have the advantage of physical proximity – both are based in Schwedt/Oder, Germany – as well as a joint vision to rid the world of problematic single use packaging. Simply put, their collective technologies come together to create a defining circular economy offer.</p>
<p class="p1">“This merging of our interests has been on the horizon for some time, it is simply the logical step which will enable both companies to develop their individual and collective offers at a substantially increased rate.” Remarked Richard Hurding, Managing &amp; Technical director of Zelfo and Eduardo Gordillo, CEO &amp; Founder of India</p>
<p class="p1">The key benefit they see in joining forces and pooling both their knowledge and resources, is the ability to coordinate and streamline R&amp;D in order to accelerate innovation and the creation of new intellectual property. Furthermore, a clear advantage of the alliance will be the ability to deliver a broader solution to their clients as more stages of raw material and product development can now be jointly addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>ABOUT ZELFO TECHNOLOGY:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Zelfo Technology GmbH’s mission is to upgrade and valorize a wide range of cellulosic &amp; ligno-cellulosic materials. The company’s Engineered Fibre solutions are the result of several years of know-how development resulting in a portfolio of patented systems which are powerful tools for companies looking to involve themselves in the circular economy. This is complimented by In-house expertise and a series of international partnerships which substantiate the company’s bio-based materials, design and manufacturing knowledge.

<p class="p1"><strong>ABOUT BIO-LUTIONS:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS is a Hamburg-based Clean Tech company that mechanically converts agricultural residues into unique, self-binding, durable fibcro® natural fibres. This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose extraction. The unique production process gives previously unused agricultural residues a second life as raw materials. These fibcro® natural fibres can now be used to produce sustainable packaging and disposable tableware, among other things. These sustainable products offer an optimal alternative to common products made of paper and plastic. The concept of decentralised production is a fundamental aspect of the BIO-LUTIONS philosophy because sustainable materials must also be sustainably sourced. The Clean Tech start-up was founded in 2017 and is currently expanding in Asia and Europe. The first factory was opened 3 years ago in Bangalore, India, and is now being followed by the approximately 1800mÇ production facility in Schwedt, Germany.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hamburg, 04 February 2021:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BIO-LUTIONS accelerates growth of German production site through a Pre-Series B with existing investors in the amount of 2.7 million euros </strong></p>
<p>Hamburg-based CleanTech startup BIO-LUTIONS has again secured funding from its shareholders. Delivery Hero SE and other existing investors have provided 2.7 million euros in a preliminary Series B round. The more substantial Series B financing round is scheduled for later this year.</p>
<p>The preliminary round serves to accelerate the expansion of production at the Schwedt site in order to create larger production capacities in the future. The decision by the German parliament to adopt the EU ban on single-use plastic into German law is increasing the pressure on German industry enormously. From mid-2021, plastic straws, cutlery and other disposable plastic items are to disappear from stores in the EU.</p>
<p>With its sustainable packaging and disposable products made from agricultural fibers, BIO-LUTIONS offers an ideal alternative. The Hamburg-based company&#8217;s production process gives currently unused agricultural residues a second life as raw materials to replace conventional plastic and paper products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chancen Magazin KfW, Olivia Höner</p>
<p><strong>Eduardo Gordillo has found a way to cut down the mountains of plastic waste. His firm Bio-Lutions is manufacturing packaging material and disposable tableware made from crop waste. It&#8217;s cost-effective, 100% compostable and provides benefits for smallholders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr Gordillo, 2017 is a crucial year for your firm Bio-Lutions. For five years, you have been developing and testing a new packaging material made from crop waste. Now it’s going into production.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. At the moment, we’re only manufacturing 600 kg a month in our Indian pilot plant. Once we finish extending the factory in April 2018, however, we’ll be making six tonnes a day.</p>
<p><strong>Who are your customers?</strong></p>
<p>Our customers include Bigbasket, India’s biggest online supermarket, as well as Licious, India’s biggest online butcher, and Coffee Day, the Indian equivalent of Starbucks. We also have distributors who sell large quantities of our disposable tableware. We have so much interest from potential customers that we’re already planning to build a second production line in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there such huge demand in India?</strong></p>
<p>The Indians need solutions right away. Their refuse collection system doesn&#8217;t work, and in the streets there’s just rubbish, rubbish, rubbish everywhere you look. Most of it is plastic. In India, cows are sacred and are allowed to roam freely. They eat this plastic and then they die. Here in Germany, our waste is less visible. Obviously, Germany needs to cut down on plastic packaging, too. But in other countries, the cry is more urgent: Here! Now! Immediately!</p>
