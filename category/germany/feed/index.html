										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The German Clean Tech Startup BIO-LUTIONS and PulPac, the Dry Molded Fiber pioneer are natural allies in their objective to replace single-use plastics globally.</strong><strong> Together with machine suppliers, they have developed a Dry Molded Fiber production line, set to start production in the new BIO-LUTIONS factory in Schwedt/Oder, Germany by the summer of 2022.</strong></p>
<p>BIO-LUTIONS mechanically converts agricultural residues into unique, self-binding, durable <strong>fibcro</strong><sup>®</sup> natural fibers. This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose isolation, as the whole fiber is used. From these fibers together with the dry moulding technology, BIO-LUTIONS will produce a variety of sustainable single-use disposable products such as service food items (cutlery and tableware) as well as protein,fruit and vegetable packaging. By introducing the new dry moulding technology provided by PulPac, production can now benefit from the unique cost and quality advantages compared to existing cellulose forming solutions.</p>
<p>The cooperation with PulPac opens the door to an additional production technology for fibre moulding, allowing for technology diversification as well as optimisation of dry moulding processes. The Dry Molded Fiber technology saves significant amounts of valuable water resources and energy, resulting in up to 80% lower CO2 footprint compared to alternatives. The process is extremely fast and more efficient than conventional fiber forming methods. While the Dry Molded Fiber technology will not be used for all BIO-LUTIONS’ products, it does offer significant production advantages for a large variety of single-use products.</p>
<p>“Each company brings something unique and valuable to the table. Being able to create partnerships that prioritize creating real solutions to the plastic age, rather than trying to build walls is what will make true change possible. That is why we are very excited to include dry moulding from PulPac as a second core production technique” Eduardo Gordillo, CEO BIO-LUTIONS.</p>
<p>“BIO-LUTIONS is an innovative and fast-moving partner. We share a doer attitude and a clear-cut commitment to replace single-use plastics at scale. Having products on the market already this year will take the concept of sustainable packaging a big leap forward. We look forward to a long-term partnership where we can share know-how and expertise to leverage the full potential of dry moulding within BIO-LUTIONS’ operations and customer network.” says Linus Larsson, CEO, PulPac AB.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>23. March 2022, Hamburg:</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><strong>BIO-LUTIONS, a German CleanTech Startup pioneering the world of natural fiber </strong><strong>manufacturing, is working with Solenis, a leading global producer of specialty chemicals </strong><strong>to produce sustainable disposable alternatives to single-use plastic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS a Hamburg-based CleanTech company, mechanically converts agricultural residues into unique, self-binding, durable fibcro<span class="s1">® </span>natural fibers. This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose isolation, as the fiber itself is used. From these fibers,</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS creates a variety of sustainable single-use disposable products and packaging. Solenis, a leading global producer of specialty chemicals, is partnering with BIO-LUTIONS, to develop more sustainable disposable products to replace various single-use plastic products in food packaging applications.</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS is using Solenis’ portfolio of barrier coatings for fiber-based products, which includes a range of products that repel water and water vapor, hot and cold liquids and oils and greases. These barrier coatings are available as either water-based polymer emulsions or solid biowaxes and are produced using the highest level of renewable raw material content currently feasible. Most importantly, fiber-based products coated with these barrier coatings typically are repulpable, recyclable, compostable and biodegradable, thereby offering packaging producers a way to improve their sustainability credentials with brand owners, retailers and consumers.</p>
<p class="p1">“The demand for sustainable packaging has increased dramatically in recent years as consumers have become more mindful of the effects their buying choices have on the environment,” said Richard Brooks, Global Packaging Director, Food Packaging at Solenis. “Being a technology partner with such a new and innovative company like BIO-LUTIONS will allow a close working relationship where we can exchange ideas that hopefully lead to faster innovation and the creation of more sustainable disposable products for the food and beverage paper packaging market.”</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The extensive experience and know-how of Solenis is a great addition to our technical expertise in agricultural fiber-based product manufacturing. Our joint development of new barrier formulations for these products will create even more sustainable solutions for the market,” said Eduardo Gordillo, Founder and CEO of India. “The goal of our collaboration is to create innovative formulas for optimal symbiosis between the barriers and our fibcro<span class="s1">® </span>fibers, to meet the increased demand for sustainable solutions in the food and beverage industry. We are excited to work with the industry leader, Solenis, and to start addressing the complex challenges of the market together.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>09.December 2021, Germany:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Bio-based tech companies India and Zelfo Technology GmbH </strong><strong>announce a fusion of their interests. Active in agro-fibre engineering and end product </strong><strong>manufacturing, both innovative companies have deepened their relationship together via a </strong><strong>share exchange.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This move comes after a long courtship of 8 years involving a virtual co-habitation of each other’s businesses and continued cooperation. Both companies have played the long game, starting with a vision beyond the accepted horizon of sustainable practice back in 2014. The mutual goal was clear: to replace disposable plastic products by finding a way to make natural fibres gained from agricultural residuals a usable raw material.</p>
<p class="p1">Beginning with a “no limits trial and error” approach back in 2014, the two newcomers to the moulded fibre market took on an industry with little idea of what could or wouldn’t work! Cake tins, microwaves, hot plates, hand mixers etc. were used along the way to get the basis of agricultural fibre composites to mesh together. Today, their technology includes 3 unique patents, covering fibre processing, machine components as well as wet and dry fibre molding.</p>
<p class="p1">The share exchange of these two innovative companies strengthens their natural alliance and paves the way for greater market impact. Fibre engineering experts ZELFO Technology and Clean Tech Startup BIO-LUTIONS with their focus on natural fibre product development and manufacturing, will further intensify their cooperation in a strategic move forward. The companies have the advantage of physical proximity – both are based in Schwedt/Oder, Germany – as well as a joint vision to rid the world of problematic single use packaging. Simply put, their collective technologies come together to create a defining circular economy offer.</p>
<p class="p1">“This merging of our interests has been on the horizon for some time, it is simply the logical step which will enable both companies to develop their individual and collective offers at a substantially increased rate.” Remarked Richard Hurding, Managing &amp; Technical director of Zelfo and Eduardo Gordillo, CEO &amp; Founder of India</p>
<p class="p1">The key benefit they see in joining forces and pooling both their knowledge and resources, is the ability to coordinate and streamline R&amp;D in order to accelerate innovation and the creation of new intellectual property. Furthermore, a clear advantage of the alliance will be the ability to deliver a broader solution to their clients as more stages of raw material and product development can now be jointly addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>ABOUT ZELFO TECHNOLOGY:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Zelfo Technology GmbH’s mission is to upgrade and valorize a wide range of cellulosic &amp; ligno-cellulosic materials. The company’s Engineered Fibre solutions are the result of several years of know-how development resulting in a portfolio of patented systems which are powerful tools for companies looking to involve themselves in the circular economy. This is complimented by In-house expertise and a series of international partnerships which substantiate the company’s bio-based materials, design and manufacturing knowledge.

<p><strong>BIO-LUTIONS accelerates growth of German production site through a Pre-Series B with existing investors in the amount of 2.7 million euros </strong></p>
<p>Hamburg-based CleanTech startup BIO-LUTIONS has again secured funding from its shareholders. Delivery Hero SE and other existing investors have provided 2.7 million euros in a preliminary Series B round. The more substantial Series B financing round is scheduled for later this year.</p>
<p>The preliminary round serves to accelerate the expansion of production at the Schwedt site in order to create larger production capacities in the future. The decision by the German parliament to adopt the EU ban on single-use plastic into German law is increasing the pressure on German industry enormously. From mid-2021, plastic straws, cutlery and other disposable plastic items are to disappear from stores in the EU.</p>
<p>With its sustainable packaging and disposable products made from agricultural fibers, BIO-LUTIONS offers an ideal alternative. The Hamburg-based company&#8217;s production process gives currently unused agricultural residues a second life as raw materials to replace conventional plastic and paper products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chancen Magazin KfW, Olivia Höner</p>
<p><strong>Eduardo Gordillo has found a way to cut down the mountains of plastic waste. His firm Bio-Lutions is manufacturing packaging material and disposable tableware made from crop waste. It&#8217;s cost-effective, 100% compostable and provides benefits for smallholders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr Gordillo, 2017 is a crucial year for your firm Bio-Lutions. For five years, you have been developing and testing a new packaging material made from crop waste. Now it’s going into production.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. At the moment, we’re only manufacturing 600 kg a month in our Indian pilot plant. Once we finish extending the factory in April 2018, however, we’ll be making six tonnes a day.</p>
<p><strong>Who are your customers?</strong></p>
<p>Our customers include Bigbasket, India’s biggest online supermarket, as well as Licious, India’s biggest online butcher, and Coffee Day, the Indian equivalent of Starbucks. We also have distributors who sell large quantities of our disposable tableware. We have so much interest from potential customers that we’re already planning to build a second production line in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there such huge demand in India?</strong></p>
<p>The Indians need solutions right away. Their refuse collection system doesn&#8217;t work, and in the streets there’s just rubbish, rubbish, rubbish everywhere you look. Most of it is plastic. In India, cows are sacred and are allowed to roam freely. They eat this plastic and then they die. Here in Germany, our waste is less visible. Obviously, Germany needs to cut down on plastic packaging, too. But in other countries, the cry is more urgent: Here! Now! Immediately!</p>
