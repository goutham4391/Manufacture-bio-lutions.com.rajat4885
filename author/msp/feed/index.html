										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>23. March 2022, Hamburg:</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><strong>BIO-LUTIONS, a German CleanTech Startup pioneering the world of natural fiber </strong><strong>manufacturing, is working with Solenis, a leading global producer of specialty chemicals </strong><strong>to produce sustainable disposable alternatives to single-use plastic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS a Hamburg-based CleanTech company, mechanically converts agricultural residues into unique, self-binding, durable fibcro<span class="s1">® </span>natural fibers. This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose isolation, as the fiber itself is used. From these fibers,</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS creates a variety of sustainable single-use disposable products and packaging. Solenis, a leading global producer of specialty chemicals, is partnering with BIO-LUTIONS, to develop more sustainable disposable products to replace various single-use plastic products in food packaging applications.</p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS is using Solenis’ portfolio of barrier coatings for fiber-based products, which includes a range of products that repel water and water vapor, hot and cold liquids and oils and greases. These barrier coatings are available as either water-based polymer emulsions or solid biowaxes and are produced using the highest level of renewable raw material content currently feasible. Most importantly, fiber-based products coated with these barrier coatings typically are repulpable, recyclable, compostable and biodegradable, thereby offering packaging producers a way to improve their sustainability credentials with brand owners, retailers and consumers.</p>
<p class="p1">“The demand for sustainable packaging has increased dramatically in recent years as consumers have become more mindful of the effects their buying choices have on the environment,” said Richard Brooks, Global Packaging Director, Food Packaging at Solenis. “Being a technology partner with such a new and innovative company like BIO-LUTIONS will allow a close working relationship where we can exchange ideas that hopefully lead to faster innovation and the creation of more sustainable disposable products for the food and beverage paper packaging market.”</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The extensive experience and know-how of Solenis is a great addition to our technical expertise in agricultural fiber-based product manufacturing. Our joint development of new barrier formulations for these products will create even more sustainable solutions for the market,” said Eduardo Gordillo, Founder and CEO of India. “The goal of our collaboration is to create innovative formulas for optimal symbiosis between the barriers and our fibcro<span class="s1">® </span>fibers, to meet the increased demand for sustainable solutions in the food and beverage industry. We are excited to work with the industry leader, Solenis, and to start addressing the complex challenges of the market together.”</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>About BIO-LUTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="p1">BIO-LUTIONS is a Hamburg-based Clean Tech company that mechanically converts agricultural residues into unique, self-binding, durable fibcro®<span class="s1"> </span>natural fibers. This patented method eliminates the need for binding agents or chemical cellulose isolation. The unique production process gives previously unused agricultural residues a second life as raw materials. These fibcro<span class="s1">® </span>natural fibers can now be used to produce sustainable packaging and disposable tableware, among other things. These sustainable products offer an optimal alternative to common products made of paper and plastic. The concept of decentralized production is a fundamental aspect of the BIO-LUTIONS philosophy because sustainable materials must also be sustainably sourced. The German Clean Tech start-up was founded in 2017 and is currently expanding in Asia and Europe. The first factory was opened in Bangalore, India, and is now being followed by the approximately 1800m<span class="s1">2 </span>production facility in Schwedt, Germany.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>We are thrilled to announce that BIO-LUTIONS is part of this year’s FoodTech500 by </strong><strong>Forward Fooding, the world’s first definitive list of the global entrepreneurial talent at </strong><strong>the intersection between food, technology, and sustainability.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This year’s FoodTech500 ranking has finally been announced and we at BIO-LUTIONS are extremely happy to share with you that on our first application to the list, we ranked at a fantastic 80<span class="s1">th </span>place among some of the world’s most significant players at the intersection between food, technology, and sustainability. With over 2,250+ applicants from over 85 countries, we are so pleased that our innovation within the food system has been selected as one of the 500 companies honored this year.</p>

With a top score of 284 for the highest ranked company, we are extremely proud with our overall score of 223 points and to be ranked 80th globally.
